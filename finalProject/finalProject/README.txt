2. Transformation of the cube (2)
3. Ability to view the cube from multiple views (3)
4. Ability to generate different projections of the cube (5)

Approach:

My approach for this project was to look at sources online to help me get started (see "Other Sources Used"), and then implement as many features as I can stated in the e-mail (copied over to Assignment Description).

Problems:

I ran into problems trying to map the texture (script/images/marble.jpg) to the faces of the cube. I brainstormed a way to do it, but it would map incorectly and wouldnt form to the shape of the cube.

I also ran into a problem trying to figure out an algorithm that would implement sheering to the cube. Each face would need an specific trait to tell each of them appart, then I would have to distort the coordinates in a way that skews the cube.
